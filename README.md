# Welcome to the Brisbane Elixir Meetup!

This group is for anyone interested in learning the Elixir programming language and meeting other Elixir/Erlang enthusiasts. We're all new to Elixir here, so welcome anybody to come along, learn and share their experiences with Elixir and/or Erlang.

Join us on [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/brisbane-elixir/) for notifications of new meetups.

# Share and Learn

Have you made something cool with Elixir? Found an interesting package? Learned a new trick? We want to hear about it!

Create a [new issue](https://github.com/BrisElixir/meetups/issues/new) with the details, and we'll get it on the schedule for an upcomming meetup.

# Locations

In 2018 we'll be relocating the meetup from our spriritual home in the LGIA building to a couple of beautiful new locations in the CBD.
